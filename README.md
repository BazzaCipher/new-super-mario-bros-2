# Food Photo Journal (Hackiethon project)

This app was a project for Hackiethon 2021, which had the theme of solving a problem faced when working/learning from home. 

This website is designed to bring awareness to your diet. During lockdown, a habit has appeared of eating the same processed foods every day to save energy. Here, we ask you to keep a "photo journal" of every meal you eat: that way, you can reflect on what foods you commonly eat and any deficiencies in your diet. You can upload images of the meals you eat to keep track of your food, and as part of a gamification element, you are awarded a 'foodimal' for each image you upload.

Also see the other component of the app, [nodejs-quality-compression](https://github.com/BazzaCipher/nodejs-quality-compression).
